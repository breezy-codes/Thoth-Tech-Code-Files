# Peer Review Code Testing

I did a peer review for the pull request found [here](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit.io-starlight/pull/218), I reviewed each program code file to ensure it met the standards and ran without errors.

### Errors

Both of the C# codes were filled with numerous errors, I worked through troubleshooting and correcting the OOP code, sharing the fix on the pull request then left a note for them to correct the top-level code.
